This is **Oak & Chisel**.

The "high-end" pivot here is crucial. The current video shows "Decking" and "Wardrobes," but to sell a premium website, we need to sell **"Bespoke Cabinetry"** and **"Heritage Restoration."**

We need to move the language away from "carpentry" (which sounds like fixing door frames) to **"Fine Joinery"** (which sounds like crafting a library for a manor house).

Here is the homepage copy for **Oak & Chisel**, designed to attract clients who want bespoke, six-figure interior fit-outs.

### The Persona: "The Heritage Artisan"
* **Tone:** Tactile, timeless, obsessive about detail.
* **Target Audience:** Owners of period properties, luxury new builds, and boutique commercial spaces (hotels/restaurants).

### 1. Hero Section (The Legacy Statement)
*The video currently says "Bespoke Joinery & Fine Cabinetry". This is good, but let's elevate the sub-text.*

**Headline:**
**Handcrafted for the Home. Designed for Forever.**

**Sub-headline:**
We don't just fill spaces; we craft legacies. Combining generational skills with modern precision to create bespoke kitchens, libraries, and architectural joinery that define a room.

**The "Heritage" Stats Bar:**
* **3rd Generation:** A family tradition of woodcraft.
* **100% Bespoke:** No templates. No flat packs. Just you.

### 2. The "Philosophy" Section (Why You?)
*High-end clients buy the "story" of the workshop.*

**Headline:**
**Master Craftsmanship, Local Roots.**

**Body:**
True joinery is an art form. In our local workshop, we select every timber for its grain and character. Whether it’s American Walnut for a study or English Oak for a staircase, we treat the material with the reverence it deserves. We bring decades of experience to every cut, joint, and finish.

**Key Selling Points:**
* **Architectural Joinery:** Restoring sash windows, crafting grand staircases, and fitting period-correct paneling.
* **Luxury Boot Rooms & Media Walls:** Functional spaces turned into design statements.
* **Bespoke Kitchens:** Hand-painted, in-frame cabinetry designed specifically for your culinary workflow.

### 3. Feature Project (Replacing the "Garden" Case Study)
*Since you are removing the current gallery images, use this text to describe the kind of image you SHOULD find (e.g., a dark, moody library or a bright, marble-topped kitchen).*

**Headline:**
**Case Study: The Cambridge Library**

**Sub-headline:**
From concept to evening ambience.

**The Story:**
* **The Brief:** The client requested a floor-to-ceiling library for their study, incorporating hidden storage and integrated lighting.
* **The Materials:** Solid Black Walnut with brass inlay detailing.
* **The Result:** A sophisticated, quiet retreat that adds both warmth and significant value to the property.

### 4. The Process (The Client Journey)
*High-end joinery is a collaborative design process. The standard "Consult > Quote > Exec" needs a slight "luxury" tweak.*

**Headline:**
**A Curated Experience from Sketch to Install**

1.  **Design Consultation:** We meet at your property to measure, discuss materials, and understand your vision.
2.  **Detailed CAD Concepts:** You receive 3D visualizations and material samples to approve before a single cut is made.
3.  **Workshop Crafting:** Your pieces are hand-built in our workshop, minimizing dust and disruption in your home.
4.  **White-Glove Installation:** Our team fits the joinery with millimetre precision, leaving your home spotless.

### 5. Testimonials (The "Perfectionist" Clients)
*We need reviews that praise the "finish" and the "manners" of the joiner.*

**Headline:**
**Excellence in Every Detail**

> **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Simply breathtaking work."**
> "The level of detail in our new library shelves is astounding. It is the centerpiece of the room. The team was respectful, tidy, and true artisans."
> — *Mrs. H. Reynolds, Ely*

> **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Better than the showroom."**
> "We looked at high-end kitchen brands, but Oak & Chisel offered better quality wood and a truly custom fit for a fairer price. The craftsmanship is flawless."
> — *Jonathan K., Saffron Walden*

### 6. The "Call to Action"
*Soft, inviting, and exclusive.*

**Headline:**

**Body:**

### Why this sells *your* service:
By using phrases like **"Production Slot"** and **"White-Glove Installation,"** you are teaching the joiner how to market themselves as a luxury brand. You are showing them that a £5k website isn't an expense; it's the tool that lets them charge £20k for a kitchen instead of £5k.
Reminder for later: For Oak & Chisel, when we eventually tackle the inner pages, we should prioritize a "Commission Process" page. High-end clients love to read about the journey (selection of timber, workshop visits, design sketches)—it makes them feel involved in the art.
